### Function: point
>The point function takes two numbers: x, y and returns one object with two numbers: x, y
```javascript
objectUtils.point(x, y)
```
### Function: ray
>The ray function uses two numbers: p1, p2 and direction: dir to return ray object with three numbers: p1, p2 and dir
```javascript
objectUtils.ray(p1, p2, dir)
```
### Function: line
>The line function uses two numbers: p1, p2 and returns a line object with two numbers: p1, p2
```javascript
objectUtils.line(p1, p2)
```
### Function: circle
>The circle function uses two numbers: p1, p2 one of them being the center point
and the second one being a point on the circumference of circle to draw it
```javascript
objectUtils.circle(p1, p2)
```
### Function: squaredLength
>The squaredLength Function takes two points and splits them into four numbers
then it uses the squared length formula to calculate squared distance between them
```javascript
const p1 = objectUtils.point(x1,y1)
const p2 = objectUtils.point(x2,y2)

objectUtils.squaredLength(p1, p2)
```
### Function: length
>The length Function is the square root of squaredLength function, we use it to calculate the distance
between two points: p1 and p2
```javascript
const p1 = objectUtils.point(x1,y1)
const p2 = objectUtils.point(x2,y2)

objectUtils.length(p1, p2)
```
### Function: center
>The center Function takes two points and splits the coordinates into single numbers and calculates the center by adding the Xs and Ys then dividing them by 2
```javascript
const p1 = objectUtils.point(x1,y1)
const p2 = objectUtils.point(x2,y2)

objectUtils.center(p1, p2)
```
### Function: intersection
>The intersection Function takes two objects that intersect with each other: obj which can be line or circle
and obj2 which can be ray or line to determine which type of intersection is it
```javascript
const obj = objectUtils.line(p1,p2) || const obj = objectUtils.circle(p1,p2)
const obj2 = objectUtils.line(p1,p2) || const obj2 = objectUtils.ray(p1, p2, dir)

objectUtils.intersection(obj, obj2)
```

### Function: perpendicular_bisector
> This function calculates the perpendicular bisector of line1
```javascript
const line1 = objectUtils.line(p1, p2)
objectUtils.perpendicular_bisector(line1)
```
### Function: normalize
> This is a simple function used to normalize the point
```javascript
const p1 = (x, y)
const p2 = (x2, y2)
const lenght = x3

objectUtils.normalize(lenght, p1, p2)
```
### Function: getDirFromAngle
> This function gives us the direction in form of a point from the angle
```javascript
objectUtils.getDirFromAngle(angle)
```
