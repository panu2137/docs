Our application allows you to freely place objects on the scene and manipulate them.

To place an object first you need to select it from the menu.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/top_panel.png" />
</Frame>
Then you draw it on the scene depending on what object is it, laser and threesixty appear right after you click and the rest is made that you can give then your own size.
